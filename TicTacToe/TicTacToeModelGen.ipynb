    "In all there are $5478$ distinct possible valid states in a Tic-Tac-Toe. A trivial analysis can tell us that maximum number of cases will be capped by $3^9 = 19683$ because every position possible can take three different values ($X$, $O$ or $\\_$ ), but this clearly is not the best estimate as out of 19683 only 5478 are possible. This also tells us why a representation consisting of more columns, having $blank_{i}$ similar to $X_{i}$s and $O_{i}$s to represent $\\_$, is not a good idea. It will increase the space in which the learning algorithm has to search for solution. Our current representation has 19 binary columns and hence the search space is constrained by $2^{19} = 524288$ size. But if we have more columns, considering $blank_{i}$ as binary columns, then the total search space size increases to $2^{28} = 268435456$. There are some other possible representations like having 9 columns, one for each position, each of which can contain three values ($0$ for $X$, $1$ for $O$ and $2$ for $\\_$ ). It is not hard to see that this representation is bad because it is attaching a weighted preference to each of possible outcomes ($X$, $O$ or $\\_$ ). It will make it hard for some of the simple algorithms like **logistic regression** to extract the meaning from this representation, even for complex models such as **ANN**s it may take more time to converge. So a good representation is one which allows us to represent data in a simple form and at the same time not increasing the search space drastically. If you would have noticed the number of rows in our training data is $10954 = 2 * (5478 - 1)$. This is because there are two possible values of $IsO$ for every state and we are not considering empty state at all so $2 * (5478 - 1)$."

So one of our childhood assumptions that putting a mark at the center takes a game towards draw is not without a reason. But of course this particular decision tree doesn't have a good accuracy. In fact the accuracy improves with the number of nodes in the decision tree and after a certain number of nodes it saturates to 1 when the decision tree overfits the training data."
